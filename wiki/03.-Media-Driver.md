# ¿What is the Media Driver?

The media driver is one of the basic concepts of [Aeron](https://github.com/real-logic/aeron) and therefore also of the [Vega Messaging](https://github.com/BBVA-CIB/Vega-Messaging) library.

In Vega the application never send messages directly through the network, there is another process that perform this job, The Media Driver.

The media driver decouples the handling of sockets, threads, buffers, etc from the vega library clients.

The connection between the clients and the media driver is done through IPC and is transparent to the library user.

**Important: The library instances cannot work without a media driver instance running on the same operative system.**

# ¿Why using a Media Driver?

The Media Driver "decouples" the applications from the transports and handling of resources. This centralised usage of resources and communications is much more efficient than replicating this process through all the clients on the same machine.

It also allows resource usage by sharing the multicast, unicast and IPC connections between clients on the same machine. For example if 2 clients are interested on the same multicast channel and they both live on the same machine, the driver will create a single socket and route the message to both clients, reducing the usage and control of resources.

It also prevent the need to specify IPC for clients on the same machine, the driver will detect it and prevent the usage of operative system sockets for messages between them.

# Media Driver Threading

The media driver uses 3 threads:

* The conductor thread for administration events.
* The sender thread.
* The receiver thread.

Depending on the latency and performance we want to achieve we can decide which kind of waiting is using between consecutive events for each one of the threads.

Normally the conductor thread can use a low usage resources waiting like and sleep or a part and the sender and receivers can do busy spin waiting for better performance.

**Active waiting means more CPU usage and it has to be used carefully.**

To simplify all this the library provide 2 Media Drivers depending on the threading model:
* MediaDriver
* * Is the base implementation that use a "park" solution between events. 
* * The threading model is "SHARED", it means it can share threads with other processes on the machine.
* * The latency is good for most cases, event low latency ones and the CPU usage is low.
* LowLatencyMediaDriver
* * BusySpin is used on this case for sender and receiver threads.
* * The threading model is "DEDICATED", it won't share resources with other threads.
* * The latency is optimal but there is a high usage of resources.

# Media Driver Types

The media driver can be external or embedded. 

## External Media Driver

The driver is an external process that can be shared between different library clients.

This is the optimal solution with better resource reutilisation. The external media driver can have the threads optimised for low latency or not as it is explained in the previous section.

This is the optimal solution, but it also means we have to control an external process to our applications and that it has to be always running for the applications to work.

## Embedded Media Driver

The other option is to launch the driver "embedded" in the library instance. The Vega library instance will launch the driver as part of the same JVM and will handle the liveness of the driver.

This solution make sense for testing purposes and also if there is going to be a single application on the machine to avoid the need to handle a separate process.

The embedded driver, like the external one can have the threads configured or not for low latency like it is explained in the previous section.

## LowLatency Media Driver VS Mormal Media Driver

The LowLatency Media driver versions, both stand alone and embedded use dedicated threading models with BusySpin IdleStrategies. This provides with the best possible latency but it also requires a huge amount of CPU.

The normal media driver uses SleepIdleStrategies of 1 milliseconds. The CPU usage is much lower but it in the worst case scenario it may cause up to 1 millisecond latency increase in some messages. This won't be a problem if the system is continuously sending and receiving messages, but can be triggered if the driver enters in the millisecond sleep due to lack of activity.

# Launching an external media driver

The external media driver can be launched by using the 2 launcher classes provided in the VegaLibrary jar file.

The main method is contained in the classes:

* com.bbva.kyof.vega.driver.StandAloneMediaDriver -> Normal implementation
* com.bbva.kyof.vega.driver.StandAloneLowLatencyMediaDriver -> Low latency implementation

It accepts a single parameter with a properties file configuration, the configuration will be reviewed in the next sections.

It can be launched as any Java application using the command line, for example:

    java -cp "LibrariesParh" $com.bbva.kyof.vega.driver.StandAloneMediaDriver &

# Media Driver Files

The media driver uses IPC to communicate with the clients and requires the creation and management of some physical files to work.

If no configuration is provided it will create a directory in a TEMP dir of the file system and will store there the files it needs.

It uses TMP/TEMP directory if not Linux otherwise /dev/shm, i.e. resulting in <java.io.tmp>/aeron-<user.name> when driver launched standalone, and <java.io.tmp>/aeron-<user.name>-<randomUUID>

**Important: For external media driver we recommend to specify the directory to use for 2 reasons.**

1. The driver launcher may not be the same than the client launcher, on that case they will try to access different directories causing an error.
1. It is easier to handle problems, delete the directory or upgrading versions if the directory for the driver is well located instead of using the default values.

## The files: Size and meaning

The media driver creates 2 files on launch:
* cnc.dat -> Contains basic information about the driver, like the version of Aeron and the internal stats.
* loss-report.dat -> Stores the report of errors and messages lost.

This 2 files are used to record the multiple stats of the driver that can be read using Aeron code.

It also creates 2 directories:
* images -> stores the buffer log files for each receiver.
* publications -> stores the buffer log files for each publisher.

For each "physical connection" and "stream Id" a new log file is created in the corresponding directory. This files are "memory mapped files" used for the IPC communication between the media driver and applications connected to it.

The size of the buffers (that correspond with the size of the files) can be configured in the media driver configuration.

**By default each buffer log file requires 50MB, and there is a log file per publisher/subscriber and per "physical connection" and "stream id".**

**Important:** It is important to limit the number of physical connection by reducing the range of IP addresses and stream IDs for the topics in the application configuration, this will reduce the number of log files required for the media driver.

**Important:** It is important to limit the number of physical connection by reducing the range of IP addresses and stream IDs for the topics in the application configuration, this will reduce the number of log files required for the media driver.

## Cleaning the temporary files

The images and publication log files are automatically deleted when the physical connection is not used anymore by an application. There is no need to manually clean this files, the media driver will free them if they are not required.

If the media driver is stopped, it will also remove all the images and publication log files before closing. 

**Important:** The media driver cannot delete the files before closing if it is stopped using a "hard kill", always try a "soft kill" first.

## Reusing the media driver directory

As explained before it is a good practice to always use the same directory for the media driver files.

**There is no need to clean the directory in each execution of the media driver.**

**There are 2 exceptions to this rule:**

* If the version of Aeron changes, the directory should be cleaned before executing the driver again.
* If there are too many errors you may want to clean in order to keep the loss-report.dat from growing too much.

# Configuration

The embedded drivers cannot be configured at the moment since they are designed for local usage and testing purposes only.

The external media driver can be configured by providing a properties configuration file when launching the driver.

It is possible to configure many parameters like the timeout against clients, max message size, buffers, etc.

You can find the whole list of parameters in the Aeron documentation:

[https://github.com/real-logic/Aeron/wiki/Configuration-Options](https://github.com/real-logic/Aeron/wiki/Configuration-Options)

¡Normally it wont be necessary to modify any of the parameters! 

The only parameter that should be modified is the driver directory in which the driver files will be stored.

## Changing the driver files directory

To manually select the driver directory the property aeron.dir should be specified in a properties file and the file path provided when the driver is launched.

Here is an example of a properties file:

    aeron.dir=/Users/cnebrera/Work/AeronContext
 
# Limitations and considerations

The Media Driver is the piece that handles the sockets, buffers, connections, etc. All the communication with the Driver is Asynchronous, this means that the sockets and resources are not open immediately after the client calls, it may take a while to perform the connections.

**¡The connection may fail!** If the IP and Port are already in use the driver won't be able to create the resource but as clients we won't know that there is something wrong.

**¡For this reason is mandatory for all the PORTS in the machine required by the driver to be reserved for the driver usage!**

There is no driver ports configuration, the driver will try to use the resources and ports that the client ask for, and the client has an XML configuration that defines all the port ranges that is going to use.

This is specially important when using embedded drivers, if 2 applications launch an embedded driver there may be a port collision and both drivers won't be able to open the same port.

**If multiple embedded drivers have to be used on the same machine is very important to check that the configurations of the applications are not sharing any port and that the ports are reserved and available.**
