There is a "trick" you need to have in mind when trying to debug your application while using the Vega Messaging Library.

Aeron will try to keep the connection with the Media Driver all the time, if it fails to do so for more than 10 seconds it will consider that something is going wring and will try to close the application.

If you are debugging by default on a "breakpoint" it will stop all the application threads. This is a big problem because it will also stop the conductor thread of the client with the media driver and it wont be able to keep the connection.

**The solution is to configure the breakpoint to only stop the current thread from running.**

In IntelliJ for example it can be easily done by doing a "right click" on the breakpoint and changing the "suspend" from all to thread.
