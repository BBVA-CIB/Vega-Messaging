# Introduction

The request / response mechanism works in a very similar way to publish / subscribe. It is also based on topics and requires the subscription to a topic on the "receiver" side and the creation of a topic publisher on the "sender" side.

The requests are "Asynchronous", a listener should be provided to get the response or responses to the request on the background.

The requests are always sent with a timeout, after the timeout expiration the request is closed and no more responses will be processed.

It is possible to listen to both received requests and timeouts using the proper listeners for each case.

Once a request is sent into the network, any subscriber for the same topic can answer the request, this means we can get responses from many clients for the same request.

The clients can send multiple responses for the same request if desired.

**Important**: The request will be "open an active" to receive new responses until it times out or it is manually cosed.

# Sending a request

Like the normal messages, the requests are sent through a previously created ITopicPublisher. The pub / sub section explains how to create it.

Requests can be sent using the method **sendRequest()** of **ITopicPublisher**.

    /**
     * Send a request on the topic.
     *
     * It will send the message contents from position() to limit() on the provided ByteBuffer.
     *
     * Try to reuse buffers if possible to reduce memory allocation.
     *
     * @param message The request message to send
     * @param timeout the timeout of the request in milliseconds
     * @param respListener Listener for responses on the request
     *
     * @return an object that represent the sent request, containing the request ID and other useful information like the publish result
     */
    SentRequest sendRequest(final ByteBuffer message, final long timeout, final IResponseListener respListener);

The method has 3 parameters:
* _message_ -> The byte buffer with the request message contents to send. It will sent the buffer contents from position() to limit()
* _timeout_ -> The timeout for the request in milliseconds. It has to be positive and bigger than 0
* _respListener_ -> The listener interface to receive the responses or timeouts into, it works on the same way than the listener interface to receive normal messages on subscription. It can be null, on this case the responses and timeouts for the sent request will be ignored.

The method returns the request that has been sent in the form of a _ISentRequest_ type object.

## The ISentRequest returned

The returned object has all the information required about the sent request, including additional methods to play with features like the expiration time. There is the whole interface definition:

    /**
    * Interface that represent a request that has been sent.<p>
    *
    * The request will be automatically closed when it expires however is a good practice to perform a manual close if no
    * more responses are expected.<p>
    *
    * No more responses for the request will be processed once the request has been closed.
    */
    public interface ISentRequest
    {
        /** @return the result of the request send */
        PublishResult getSentResult();

        /** @return the unique ID of the sent request */
        UUID getRequestId();

        /** @return  true if the request has already expired */
        boolean hasExpired();

        /**
        * Reset expiration time of the request
        *
        * @param timeout new expiration time in milliseconds. The expiration time would be now + the given timeout
        */
        void resetExpiration(long timeout);

        /** Close the request, freeing the memory and preventing new responses from being processed */
        void closeRequest();

        /** @return True if the sent request has been already closed either by the user or due to expiration */
        boolean isClosed();

        /** @return the number of responses received for this request */
        int getNumberOfResponses();
    }

The first thing to do after sending a request is to review the **PublishResult**, exactly like we do when a normal message is sent.

This time this information is inside the returned **ISentRequest** object and can be extracted by the method **getSentResult()**.

Each request sent as a unique identifier that can be retrieved using **getRequestId()**. The unique id is a 64 bits UUID that should be unique for any request and client in the network. This unique Id is also used to relate requests with their responses.

Call **hasExpired()** to know if a request has expired by timeout.

The request is keep "open" and able to receive new responses until it timeouts or is closed manually. To close a request manually use the method **closeRequest()**.

**Important**: Is a good practice to close a request manually if no more responses are expected for it.

We can check how many responses have been received for the request calling **getNumberOfResponses()**.

### Reset expiration time

In some cases we may want to resent the expiration time, specially when multiple responses are expected. For example if we expect a response every 4 milliseconds but are not sure about the number of responses, we can reset the expiration time every time a response arrives.

Use the method **resetExpiration()** with the new timeout value in milliseconds to perform this task.

## The listener interface

Lets review the **IResponseListener** interface of the sendRequest() call parameters:

    /**
    * Implement in order to receive responses to previously sent requests
    */
    public interface IResponseListener
    {
        /**
        * Method called when a response is received for a sent request.
        *
        * IMPORTANT: If the response message contents are going to be accessed from a separate thread the message should be promoted!!
        *
        * @param originalSentRequest original sent request related to the response
        * @param response the received response
        */
        void onResponseReceived(final ISentRequest originalSentRequest, final IRcvResponse response);

        /**
        * Called when a set request has timed out before being manually closed
        *
        * @param originalSentRequest the original request that has timed out
        */
        void onRequestTimeout(final ISentRequest originalSentRequest);
    }

There are 2 methods to implement to receive and process responses and timeouts. 

The thread that perform the callback for the responses comes from the poller selected in the configuration of the instance for the responses. 

The thread that perform the callback for the timeouts is always the same thread for all the vega instance and comes from the internal RequestProcessor.

**Important**: The same considerations about not blocking the thread and performance tips explained for message reception applies here as well.

**Important**: Like in the received messages, if the response message is going to be processed on a separate thread it has to be "promoted".

### The response received callback

The callback provides 2 objects, the response and the original sent request.

**The response object**

The response object is provided as an interface IRcvResponse. The only different with the IRcvMessage interface for message reception is the method _getOriginalRequestId()_ that return the RequestId this response belongs to.

This can be used to relate the sent request and the response by Ids if required or by any other purpose.

**Important**: The same concepts about not blocking threads, message promotion, etc explained for received messages also applied for received responses.

**The original sent request object**

The original sent request object returned in the callback is the same one that is returned when the request is originally performed. From this object we can check all the values of the request and even close it or change the expiration time.

**Important**: If no more responses are expected close the request on the response arrives. It will prevent the request to time out and save processing time.

    /**
    * Implement in order to listen for timeouts on sent requests
    */
    @FunctionalInterface
    public interface IReqTimeoutListener
    {
        /**
        * Called when a set request has timed out before being manually closed
        *
        * @param originalSentRequest the original request that has timed out
        */
        void onRequestTimeout(final ISentRequest originalSentRequest);
    }

### The request timeout callback

The interface is very simple and just provides the request that has timed out in the onRequestTimeout() method.

This call is performed by an internal request manager thread. The standard rules of not blocking the thread applies here as well.

# Request / Response transports

The request uses the same transport to reach the subscribers than the normal messages. For example, if the topic uses multicast on an specific IP and Port, both the requests and the messages will use the same socket to reach the subscribers. This applies to all transport types IPC, Multicast and Unicast.

The responses however don't work on the same way.  **Â¡The responses are always sent in UDP Unicast!**

For each VegaInstance an specific UDP socket is created to receive responses to request sent by the instance. This information is shared to all the applications using  the auto-discovery process. For each ApplicationID the applications knows about the socket where it expect to receive responses and will send the responses accordingly.

**Important**: If you try to send a response before the auto-discovery has been triggered with the responses information for the application it may not arrive. This is very unlikely but it can happen.

The responses socket to create for the instance can be configured to determinate the port range to use, only one port in the range will be selected. This is explained in the configuration section.

**Performance tip:** If there are several applications in the same machine that share the configuration for responses, some of them may actually share the same socket for responses. This is not a functional problem since the application that has not sent the request for the response will discard it, but it will affect the performance.

**Performance tip:** If there are going to be several applications on the same machine, provide a wide StreamIDs to ensure each one pick ups a different one. The SreamID is a good way do multiplex the information between clients. If there is a lot of traffic it can be desirable to increase also the port range to open multiple sockets.
