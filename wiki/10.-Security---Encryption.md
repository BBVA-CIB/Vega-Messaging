# Introduction

Vega messages can be secured by the use of cryptography. The security is applied per publisher and topic.

The security is performed by a previous "authentication" between subscriber and publisher using RSA Pub/Priv Key authentication.

If the authentication is correct the subscriber receives the AES Symmetric Key used by the publisher to send messages.

All this process is hidden by the framework and only special configuration is required in the applications to use it.

# Prerequisites

Each application needs a security identifier. Each pub/private RSA key pair is related to an specific security ID that should match with the security ID specified in the security parameters of the application.

Each application needs access to their own private key and to the public keys of the applications it is going to connect to.

The system works with sessions, for every topic publisher there is a session AES key that is reset every time the publisher restarts. For each session a new unique AES key is created to encode the messages between publisher and subscriber.

# Configuration

In order to work with secured communications we need to:

- Include the secure topics in the application configuration as it is explained in the configuration section.
- Add the security parameters in the vega instance parameters when the instance is created.

## Vega security parameters

The parameters contains information like the "security id" for the instance and the location of the instance private key and public keys for the applications is going to connect to. 

This could have been included in the configuration file, however these parameters are always different per application and as a result we would have needed a different configuration file per application. This is always an option but is harder to manage than sharing the configuration file for all applications in a cluster if possible.

The parameters are defined in the class "SecurityParams" that is an optional value for "_VegaInstanceParams_". All the values in "_SecurityParams_" should be provided:

    public class SecurityParams
    {
    /** Security type to use (Plain key file, encrypted key file or keystore certificates) */
        @Getter private final KeySecurityType keySecurityType;

        /** Instance security id */
        @Getter private final Integer securityId;

        /** (Optional, only for file security) Path to the directory containing the instance private key for security connections */
        @Getter private final String privateKeyDirPath;

        /** (Optional, only for file security) Path to the file containing the public keys for security connections */
        @Getter private final String publicKeysDirPath;

        /** (Optional, only for ENCRYPTED_FILE security) Password to decrypt the private key contents.
        * The password should be a Hex result of a 128 bytes AES key. 32 HEX characters. It will be a dissociated password that
        * will be XOR combined with the Vega secret password for encrypted key file. */
        @Getter private final String hexPrivateKeyPassword;
    }

    public enum KeySecurityType
    {
        /** Key files stored as plain XML text files */
        PLAIN_KEY_FILE,
        /** Private key file stored encrypted, public key files stored in plain */
        ENCRYPTED_KEY_FILE,
        /** Use a keystore to store all keys using digital certificates */
        KEYSTORE
    }

The security id should match the security id in the private key file and also in the security configuration of the instance.

For the keys we only need to specify the directory the keys are stored into. The key file names should follow an specific name pattern so they can be detected by the library. The pattern is very simple: _VEGA_PUB_KEY{SecurityID}.xml_ or _VEGA_PRIV_KEY{SecurityID}.xml_. For example VEGA_PUB_KEY_11111.xml

## Public and private key files

The key files are XML files containing the secure id the key belongs to and the value for the key. Public and private key are stored in separate files and each file contains the key for a single security id.

As explained before the file names follows a pattern:

_VEGA_PUB_KEY{SecurityID}.xml_
_VEGA_PRIV_KEY{SecurityID}.xml_

The pattern is designed to help the application to load the file contents from disk looking for the right security id.

The private key can be encrypted with a dissociated password. It will be explained later.

Here is an example of a generated key file, the value of the key is encoded in Base64 to convert it to String:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <private_key xmlns="http://www.bbva.com/vega/priv_key" app_security_id="11111" isKeyEncrypted="true">

    </private_key>

# How does it work

The framework use a special unicast channel to send control messages between vega instances. Each time a secure subscriber topic detects that there is a new secure publisher topic with the same topic name, the process to retrieve the session key for the messages sent by the topic publisher starts.

The control system send security requests messages to the vega instance containing the secure topic publisher, the receiver instance verify the message and the permissions and answer to the original requester with the session key or with a security response error in case it has no permissions or there is any kind of problem.

If messages from the secure topic publisher arrives before the session key has been retrieved, they are automatically discarded.

**Important**: The encryption is applied to all normal messages sent by the topic publisher but not to request / responses or control messages.

The handshake to obtain the session key is secured by digital signature in both directions and by public key encryption to share the key.

The next scheme illustrates the process:

![Vega Security](https://github.com/BBVA-CIB/Vega-Messaging/blob/master/wiki/vegasecurity.png)

## Step 1: The application with the subscriber perform a security request to the publisher application

The subscriber needs to authenticate with he publisher and obtain the secret AES key used for the current publisher session.

In order to authenticate the subscriber application send a request with:

- The subscriber vega instance unique ID.
- The publisher vega instance unique ID.
- A unique random generated ID for the request.
- The unique Id of the topic publisher it wants the Session Key for
- It's own security id
- All this information is signed by the subscriber application using RSA signature.

## Step 2: The publisher application responds with the AES key for communication

The publisher application receives the message, since it has the public key of the subscriber application it can verify itÂ´s authenticity. 

If the subscriber that is trying to authenticate is valid (the application security id is in the list of valid id's for the topic), the publisher application respond with he AES Key. The response in this case is more complex and contains:

- The publisher application unique ID.
- The subscriber application unique ID.
- The topic publisher unique ID.
- The original request ID. It is used to allow the subscriber to correlate the original request with the publisher response.
- It's own security id
- The AES key for the session encoded with the public key of the subscriber application. This ensures that only the subscriber can extract the AES key.
- All the message is signed by the publisher, in this way the publisher authenticates also against the subscriber.

## Step 3: Decode the publisher messages

Now the subscriber connects to the publisher and start receiving live messages. Each message contains:

- The message type
- The unique identifier of the publisher application. 
- The topic id.
- The message contents encoded in AES.

**Important**: The process of obtaining the session key occurs in the background. If a secure message arrives before the session key has been retrieved it will be ignored.

# Encrypted private Keys

The private key can be encrypted to prevent it from being stolen. When encryption for private key is used, the key contents on the XML file are encrypted with a 128 bits AES key. The encryption key is a dissociated password that is conformed by 2 keys:

* An internal hidden key.
* A user provided key.

The final key is the result of performing an XOR over the internal hidden key and the user provided key. The key provided by the user has to be the same key used to create the encrypted private key.

The user has to provide the key as a 64 characteres HEX String.

# Priv / Pub keys generation

The framework contains a utility class _com.bbva.kyof.vega.config.util.KeyPairGenerator_ that can be used from the command line to generate the Public and Private key files for an application.

It will generate 2 files using in the name of the given security id. For example if the security ID is 12345, the generated files will be:

_LLZ_PUB_KEY_12345.xml_
_LLZ_PRIV_KEY_12345.xml_

The generator requires at least 3 arguments. Here is a copy of the usage:

_"3 Parameters required: keyType (PLAIN, ENCRYPTED, CERTIFICATE), application security id (long) and destination directory." +_
        _" If ENCRYPTED type is used, a forth parameter should be provided with " +_
        _"a 32 character HEX string with the private key encryption password if Ej: ENCRYPTED 26548769 /home/keys A456FH4263BC3451"_

It is executed like any normal java application with a Main method, here is an example considering that the instance id is 12345 and the destination directory is /home/user/keysdir:

_java -cp KYOF-VegaMessagingLibrary-1.0.0.jar com.bbva.kyof.vega.config.util.KeyPairGenerator PLAIN 12345 /home/user/keysdir_

# Security limitations and risks

## Stolen AES Key

The only current security limitation is that the AES key for the publisher + topic is going to be used by all the subscribers connected to that publisher.

This means that if the AES key is stolen for a session it can be used by someone else to send modified messages to all subscribers on that topic.

The solution would be to duplicate the messages for each subscriber with separate AES keys but it has a huge performance impact and therefore is not going to be implemented.

## Brute force Attach

If the publisher is never restarted the current session may be active for a very long period. This is a risk for brute force attacks if an attacker has been sniffing packages and has enough computational power to break the key.
